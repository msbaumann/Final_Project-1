Ten Minute Plan
	I am now investigating gene expression of seratonergic neurons in C. elegans. This will be done by comparing the
RNA expression in seratonergic neurons and reference neurons from C. elegans. The data was aqcuired from this paper: 
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112102#s6. Major challenges currently include munging 
the data by the expressed gene for comparison. I suspect this can be done through regular expressions as each entry has 
the same gene code (e.g. zf1), but a different number.
